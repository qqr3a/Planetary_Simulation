## Installation

### Steps
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qqr3a/Planetary_Simulation.git

## Usage

1. Run the simulation
   ```bash
   python path/to/planetarySimulation/main.py

Keybinds are present in info menu

## Issues 

Crash at extreme velocity sizes relative to most massive body
Crash when scale is lower sub-planet size

## Todo

Elastic collisions
Mid-simulation modify/add body
Relative scaling of both velocity and acceleration arrows
